project title: CPR
CPR is a heart-shaped keyboard that replaces the moving mouse by pressing up, down, left and right. The reason I stand for CPR is that my wearable device is made to move in the desired direction by placing it where the heart is located and pressing each button. I wanted to make a wearable device that can be worn over clothes with a pin. It can be worn on any body part that can be reached by a clothespin. The way it works can be moved in the desired direction and changed direction by pressing the desired part.
