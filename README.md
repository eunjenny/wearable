Project Title: CPR - Heart-Shaped Wearable Keyboard

Project Description:

CPR is an innovative wearable keyboard designed to replace traditional mouse input by offering a unique and intuitive method of controlling a computer's cursor. The general concept behind CPR is to provide a wearable input device that responds to directional presses, allowing users to navigate their computers effortlessly.

What the Wearable Is:
CPR takes the form of a heart-shaped device, made from lightweight and flexible materials. It is designed to be pinned onto clothing, making it versatile and adaptable for various body positions. The heart shape is not just a design choice but also symbolizes the user's connection with the device.

How it Behaves/Performs and Why:
CPR behaves by registering directional presses on its surfaceâ€”up, down, left, and right. When the user presses one of these buttons, the device sends corresponding commands to the connected computer, allowing for cursor movement and navigation. This design choice aims to offer an ergonomic and intuitive way to interact with a computer, reducing the strain caused by traditional mouse usage.
